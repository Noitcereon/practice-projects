# Practice Projects

I created this repository to house all my practice projects (only intended for practice, nothing else). 
The "projects" are often on the small side, to try out only a specific functionality, but in other cases they go a bit further, e.g. web app with keycloak.

I started this repo on the 7th of June 2022 and merged *some* of my previous practice projects into here, so the git history is a bit cluttered during the
startup period.

## Installation

Some of the projects in here require installation before they can be run. Often it is only something like an `npm install` command, 
for others it may require more or nothing at all.

My Java projects (at the time of writing) are run with the IntelliJ IDE.

My .NET projects are run using Visual Studio IDE.

For more complex setups a subfolder README.md file should be present.

## Usage

The purpose of this repo is:
1. To enable everyone -including myself- to look at this code anywhere.
2. To have version control over my smaller projects without making tons of GitHub repositories.

So just clone this repo and look at the code (and potentially try and run it).
