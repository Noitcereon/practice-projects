# Complete Java 8 Dev Bootcamp Code

This contains code I made during the course. I skipped several labs, such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, due to having already worked with it. Therefore, this
is probably not a good project to reference for "good code" .

The Udemy course can be found at the following link: <https://dxc.udemy.com/course/learn-java-se-8-and-prepare-for-the-java-associate-exam> (<https://udemy.com/course/learn-java-se-8-and-prepare-for-the-java-associate-exam>)
