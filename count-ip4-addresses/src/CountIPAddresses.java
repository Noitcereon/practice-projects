    // Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between them (including the first one, excluding the last one).
    //
    // All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be greater than the first one.
    // Examples:
    // * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.0.50"  => return   50
    // * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.1.0"   => return  256
    // * With input "20.0.0.10", "20.0.1.0"  => return  246
